# Black_Hate_Crime_Analysis
I was deeply disheartened by what happened to Mr George Floyd on 25th May 2020. So I decided to find patterns to track the origins of racist crimes in the US.

# Mission
The more data we can collect the more trends we can identify and get to the roots of the situation. You can add databases, articles, researches etc that can help us draw conclusions and/or dependencies.

# Visualizations

I have made a few analytical graphs to identify trends based on the data I gathered. Hope this proves fruitful.
Note: Please add any of your visualizations or data predictions in the visualization folder.

The visualizations were done in Matplotlib in Python and MATLAB. Source codes have been posted. If you wish to add any visualizations please add the source codes and the data along with it to maintain credibility and authenticity of the project. Thank you for your cooperation !!!
